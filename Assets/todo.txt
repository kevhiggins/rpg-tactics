Make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.
Allow walking through own units.

LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.




Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection
Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.
