Make sure that AI units unitinfo box is showing up on cursor selection.
Next up, make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.
Also, make the movement speed standardized per tile. (Make this configurable.)

When fighter attacks a unit, they should have a lower zindex


LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.





Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.


Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection


See if there is a GetNodes within X distance function for A*

				/** Which graph tags are traversable.
		 * This is a bitmask so -1 = all bits set = all tags traversable.
		 * For example, to set bit 5 to true, you would do
		 * \code myPath.enabledTags |= 1 << 5; \endcode
		 * To set it to false, you would do
		 * \code myPath.enabledTags &= ~(1 << 5); \endcode
		 *
		 * The Seeker has a popup field where you can set which tags to use.
		 * \note If you are using a Seeker. The Seeker will set this value to what is set in the inspector field on StartPath.
		 * So you need to change the Seeker value via script, not set this value if you want to change it via script.
