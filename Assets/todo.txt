Bug:
Problem:
Moving to next state should wait for the camera to finish centering on the cursor.
	Fix issue where long camera panning is interrupted by AI movement cursor. Panning should finish.

Situations where the camera can move:
-Switching the active unit
-Returning to the active unit after cancelling the explore state
-AI selecting movement destination/Attack

Solutions:
Create a method for moving the cursor that has an onComplete built in.
Whenever we change the cursor position, we should be using that method instead, to avoid weirdness on cursor moves.

Make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.
Make sure that AI units unitinfo box is showing up on cursor selection.

When fighter attacks a unit, they should have a lower zindex

Cleanse old code
Allow walking through own units.

Add some simple SFX polish

Fighter setup




Good Maps:
jTEST:

Diagonal ones

Kev

Add test mode:
	Show grid and make tiles for empty tiles.


Menu sometimes will appear in the wrong place somehow.
	Figure out how to reproduce

LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.




Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection
Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.
