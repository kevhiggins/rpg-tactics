Set Node passability and penalties using ITileMap

Tile Editor Bugs:
Selecting the prefab from the projects window also triggers the TilePicker stuff, and it's buggy.

TODO Determine a way to store the sprite + other info to be used when drawn.

Make sure that AI units unitinfo box is showing up on cursor selection.
Next up, make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.
Also, make the movement speed standardized per tile. (Make this configurable.)

When fighter attacks a unit, they should have a lower zindex


LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.





Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.
