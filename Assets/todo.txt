Make 5 maps for next meeting.
Cleanse old code

Fighter setup

AI Pathfinding is not honoring tile penalties
Nearest node doesn't appear to be properly honoring penalties

If a unit is trapped, and cannot move, the camera sorta freaks out. Might want more delays between their actions.
	Seems like it may also cause the menus to freak out on player turnw

Bug: Fix penalty

Add test mode:
	Show grid and make tiles for empty tiles.


Menu sometimes will appear in the wrong place somehow.
	Figure out how to reproduce

Next Up:
Set Node passability and penalties using ITileMap

Tile Editor Bugs:


Multiple instances of the same unit don't seem to be attacking.

TODO Determine a way to store the sprite + other info to be used when drawn.
When changing a color or value in the Tile Map inspector, make the change propogate to all existing tiles.
If you deselect the Tile Map, change the tile picker menu, and then reselect it, it doesn't immediately pick up on the changes.

Fix issue where brush sometimes has duplicates.
	-Seems to happen by pressing play

Center the tile map on the camera

Update A* math with the corresponding Passable/Penalty tiles from Tiled
Abstract unit starting positions, so they are not tied to the unit.

Cursor seems unnatural when it switched back to enemy after attack, and then immediately to the next unit
Add Joe's fighter unit



Make sure that AI units unitinfo box is showing up on cursor selection.
Next up, make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.
Also, make the movement speed standardized per tile. (Make this configurable.)

When fighter attacks a unit, they should have a lower zindex


LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.





Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.


Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection
