LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.

GAME:
X - Hook up Pop EXP and Pop DMG if it broke
X - Hook up level up noise and make a POP for it?
X - Wait until the proper attack animation frame to deal damage
X - Wait until enemy is done dying to end turn AND to give EXP.

Bug: Fix issue with death vs attack and how if one gets shorter we will get bugs.




Cursor appear on enemy
Add attack comparison for enemy?

Delays:
After Move
After attack
Level up delay


Potential Things:
Allow configuring delays between GameStates
Allow configuring delays 
Figure out a better way to determing the end of animation states

camera

Allow doing both move and attack in the same turn.
	-Once one of them is done, the option needs to be greyed out.

Make sure that nodes with units on them don't count as walkable.
Use A* pathfinding to generate the nearest nodes. Need it to take into account obstacles





Look into saving previous menu states

Test animation triggers for blood particle effect.


Add bloop when menu confirms

Visual cue for being able to perform an action

Unit's should have move called on them instead of maps?

Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection

Refactor gamestate code?
Decide on namespace usage. Either Rpg.* or Assets.Scripts.*

See if there is a GetNodes within X distance function for A*


Add a onDamageTaken event
