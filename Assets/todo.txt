Fix bug where double turns show the menu in the wrong location
	-Problem is that the menu is created next to the unit as it starts moving, and then it moves away. Ideally, we should be waiting to allow more actions until the unit is done moving.

Move menu next to highlighted unit

Add bloop when menu confirms

Add enemy unit(s)
Allow attacking
Allow enemy to move
Allow units to die
Add wait action

Unit's should have move called on them instead of maps?

Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection

Refactor gamestate code?
Decide on namespace usage. Either Rpg.* or Assets.Scripts.*
