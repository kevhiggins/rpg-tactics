Create Menu for selecting skills
Make sure that the script for selecting a target is generalized to work for both skills and attack
See if the battle system can be generalized for both skills and attack.

Should make sure that testing the skills can actually display mock hit popups as well.

Test target unit
Contemplate how to do a move like Life Drain

Control hits
Make multiple targets possible
Make sure you can target empty tiles



Research shaders (How do they work?)

Wishlist:
Camera movement (Screen shake)


Talk to Joe
Spell hits/dmg
	over time
	direct
	aoe
		Allow specifying cross/line etc



Prioritize skill stuff next
Fireball

Bugs:
Fix layer overlap issue for units:
	Move first guy on jMap 7 Test to above the guy to his right

Features:
Make the unit follow the specific path, instead of fly like a bird to their destination.

Cleanup:
Remove Friendly and Enemy classes. Create a UnitClass




Figure out if it's possible to chain animation stuff together so that we can see the full picture.
Think the tackle example.
	Tackle Triggered
	Animation starts
	On hitting the enemy, sparks come out.


trigger attack/death complete automatically, so that we don't have to set it for each animation

Add editor menu item for creating a unit game object with the correct scripts attached
Seems like there are game hiccups at certain points. Look into why.





When fighter attacks a unit, they should have a lower zindex

Figure out how to make particle effects appear and disappear

Cleanse old code
	Start position from unit.




Add some simple SFX polish

Fighter setup

Good Maps:
jTEST:
8
7
Diagonal ones

Kev
4


Add test mode:
	Show grid and make tiles for empty tiles.

LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.




Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection
Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.
