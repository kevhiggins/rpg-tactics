Bug:

On enemy unit turn, go into a custom enemy unit state instead of the normal state.

Allow attacking

Hook up the hp and CT meters
Add bloop when menu confirms


Allow enemy to move
Allow units to die
Add wait action

Unit's should have move called on them instead of maps?

Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection

Refactor gamestate code?
Decide on namespace usage. Either Rpg.* or Assets.Scripts.*
