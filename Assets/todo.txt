LEARNING:
Learn about particle system from Joe
Read the Unity manual

Dream Land:
Figure out a way for the HP bar game objects to be properly shared between their parents, so that you can easily propogate updates to each.
Consider making sure that the AnimationManager script is always attached to the animation child.



-Make camera follow the units. Might want to look into how tactics does it some more, since it doesn't seem to center on the unit.


Make sure that nodes with units on them don't count as walkable.
Use A* pathfinding to generate the nearest nodes. Need it to take into account obstacles


Look into saving previous menu states when cancelling an action.


Low Priority:
Add bloop when menu confirms
Setup XBox Controller
Look into proper garbage collection


See if there is a GetNodes within X distance function for A*
